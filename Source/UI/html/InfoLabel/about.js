  <strong>Open Ephys</strong> is a nonprofit based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with team members distributed  around the world. Its mission is to advance our understanding of the brain by promoting community ownership of the tools we use to study it.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>Open Ephys GUI</strong> is free, collaboratively developed, open-source software for scientific research. It includes many features designed to make extracellular electrophysiology data easier to acquire; however, it is not guaranteed to work as advertised. Before you use it for your own experiments, you should test any capabilities you plan to use. The use of a plugin-based architecture provides the flexibility to customize your signal chain, but it also makes it difficult to test every possible combination of processors in advance. Whenever you download or upgrade the GUI, be sure to test your desired configuration in a "safe" environment before using it to collect real data.
